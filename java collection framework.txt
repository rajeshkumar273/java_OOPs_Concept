In java classes and interfaces are important

interface
	classes
		method

collections is a framework provided by java

This framework provides many interfaces and their implemented classes in order to 
		store group of objects(elements) in a single entity.

collections framework
	1. collection interface
		a. List <interface>

			1.ArrayList
			2.Linked List
			3.Vector
			4.Stack
	
		b. Set <interface>

			1.HashSet
			2.LinkedHashSet
			3.TreeSet 
		
		c. Queue <interface>
			1.ArrayQueue
			2.PriorityQueue
	collections class is also there for sorting and filter and more.

	2. Map interface



collection is group of classes & interfaces (Abstration and Interfaces we need)

	objective --> simplify usage of data structures

The Iterable interface (java.lang.Iterable) is the root interface of the Java collection classes.
The Collection interface extends Iterable interface, so all subtypes of Collection implement the Iterable interface.

This interface stands to represent data-structures whose value can be traversed one by one.

extends for classes
implements for intefaces

interfaces are true or absolute or perfect  abstraction methods 
	example is collections framework

	we are using add item without knowing internal code 
		that is example of interface.

The main difference blw ArrayList and Array 
size 

In Array Size is fixed while creating Array you have mention size (Fixed)

[dynamic] In ArrayList size is dynamic (Automatically grow size)

Vector --> Synchronized (It cannot work with more than one thread)

ArrayList --> Not Synchronized (supports Multithreading)

LinkedList --> implements doubly linked list
